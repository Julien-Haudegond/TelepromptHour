## Description

Simple Android Application to display scrolling text like a teleprompter. Based on Qt framework, this application is developed with C++ & QML and uses CMake as build system. 

The main purpose of this application is to define the text scrolling speed with a precise duration. Like this, making a speaking video which lasts exactly 72 seconds should not be a problem anymore.

## Required Features

- [ ] Scrolling Text with a custom speed based on a duration.
- [ ] Font size parameter.
- [ ] Mirroring parameter (to really use with a *teleprompter* setup).
- [ ] Timer: display elapsed time.
- [ ] Countdown with several duration options.

## Disclaimer

This is the first time I use Qt for creating an Android App and I never made Android Apps before, so this project is also a way to learn. I have no idea of the potential vulnerabilities it can has. And I am pretty sure it is not optimized and secured at all.
